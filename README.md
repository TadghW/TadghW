Currently work at Valeo’s Research and Development campus in Tuam, Ireland.

On my own time I build applications in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Rust, at work I use Java and JavaScript, I’m teaching myself Go.

I'm always interested in projects beyond the ones I'm currently invested in. Feel free to get in touch.
