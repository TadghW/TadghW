Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tadgh Wagstaff.

I'm a junior developer based in Galway, Ireland looking for a chance to progress my career and work with experienced, passionate developers.

I'm currently pursuing a higher diploma in Software Design and Development to back up years of experience working software development and IT - if you'd like to chat, please do send a message!
