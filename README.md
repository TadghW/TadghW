I'm an enthusiastic and driven software engineer who taught themselves software development as a teenager and then graduated with honours from the University of Galways Software Design and Development Higher Diploma.

Most of my experience is with Python, Java and JavaScript, but I have plenty of experience with C#, some with Rust and Go, and a bit with Assembly too! 

I'm always interested in projects beyond the ones I'm currently invested in. Feel free to get in touch.
