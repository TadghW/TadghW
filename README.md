I'm an enthusiastic and driven software engineer who taught themselves software development as a teenage and recently graduated with honours from the University of Galways Software Design and Development Higher Diploma. Most of my experience is with Java and JavaScript, but I have plenty of experience with Python, C# and Assembly too. 

I'm always interested in working on cool projects, and a lot of the stuff up here I do for fun. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions!
